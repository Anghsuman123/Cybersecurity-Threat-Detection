# Cybersecurity-Threat-Detection
MACHINE LEARNING AND DEEP LEARNING BASED CYBERSECURITY THREAT DETECTION USING NSL-KDD DATASET

The project focuses mainly on detecting and classifying cybersecurity threats in real-time using the NSL-KDD dataset, a widely used benchmark for network intrusion detection. The goal is to accurately distinguish between normal and anomalous traffic to enhance network security. Deep learning model -BiLSTM,LSTM,GRU were used and for machine learning model- Decision tree,SVM,XgBoost were used.
